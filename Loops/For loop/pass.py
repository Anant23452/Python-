# ðŸŸ¡ What is pass statement in Python?
# ðŸ”¸ pass is a null statement.

#     It means: "Do nothing"

#     Itâ€™s used when a statement is required syntactically, but you donâ€™t want to write any code there (for now).

# âœ… Why use pass?

#     ðŸ”¹ To create empty functions, loops, classes, etc.

#     ðŸ”¹ Useful during code development or debugging.

#     ðŸ”¹ Prevents syntax errors when Python expects code but you havenâ€™t written it yet.

class Student:
    pass

def hello():
    pass  # function is not implemented yet



x = 10
if x > 5:
    pass  # maybe youâ€™ll write logic later
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
